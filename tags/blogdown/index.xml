      <description>Earlier this week I was dissapointed with how little I had posted to my blog. One post from over a year ago did not fit with my personal expectations, and a ongoing goal of mine has been to write more. I originally built my website using Jekyll, since it was easy to port to github and supports markdown formatted documents. Whenever I was actively working on the website it would be easy for me to float around in that ecosystem, but given my sporatic motivation, returning to that format has become a barrier for me.</description>
