<p>Earlier this week I was dissapointed with how little I had posted to my blog. One post from over a year ago did not fit with my personal expectations, and a ongoing goal of mine has been to write more. I originally built my website using Jekyll, since it was easy to port to github and supports markdown formatted documents. Whenever I was actively working on the website it would be easy for me to float around in that ecosystem, but given my sporatic motivation, returning to that format has become a barrier. I needed a tool that would not be a barrier so since I do most of my coding in R and I am an avid Rstudio user, blogdown was an easy choice to migrate to. So far I have been really pleased with the ease of adding new posts and am excited to continue using this platform.</p>

<p>In making this site, I pulled Yuhui&rsquo;s ported adaptation of ivy for hugo and blogdown linked <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy">here</a>. I like the simplicity of it, but I immediately removed the bullet points. I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about the font, but I&rsquo;m too lazy to mess around with it at this point.</p>
