      <description>Earlier this week I was dissapointed with how little I had posted to my blog. One post from over a year ago did not fit with my personal expectations, and a ongoing goal of mine has been to write more.

Whenever I was actively working on the website it would be easy for me to float around in that ecosystem, but given my sporatic motivation, returning to that format has become a barrier.</description>

      <description>Summary Points:  Make all code chunks have different names
 Clean the cache before rebuilding the website
 Make the _site.yml simple, adding details to individual pages
 Use the &amp;lsquo;.gitignore&amp;rsquo; file and the &amp;lsquo;exclude:[]&amp;rsquo; option in the _site.yml
 Include a &amp;lsquo;footer.html&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;header.html&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;styles.css&amp;rsquo; in the _site.yml file
  In picking a tool for creating a website to display a some biological data analysis for the ctenophore project, I looked for tools that would seemlesly fit into my current data analysis framework (primarily R coding in Rmarkdown using Rstudio as my text editor).</description>
