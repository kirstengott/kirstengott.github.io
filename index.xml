      <description>Current I am broadly interested in evolutionary genomics, and for my PhD work I have joined Cameron Currie&amp;rsquo;s lab at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. In the Currie lab, we study how symbiosis shapes biodiversity. Currently, I am working with the fungus farming ant symbiosis to understand the selective forces that shape pathogen resistance in the specialized mycoparasite Escovopsis.
Previous Before joining my PhD program at the UW-Madison I worked as a bioinformaticist in Alejandro SÃ¡nchez&amp;rsquo;s lab at The Stowers Institute for Medical Research.</description>
